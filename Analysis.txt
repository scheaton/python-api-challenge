ANALYSIS

1. There is a high negative correlation (r = -0.85) between temperature and latitude in the northern hemisphere.

    It is common knowledge that temperature is warmer towards the equator for scientific reasons well beyond the means of this analysis. Imagine Colombia and Somalia then imagine Greenland and Antarctica.

2. There is a high positive correlation (r = +0.70) between temperature and latitude in the southern hemisphere.

    This correlation is weaker than in the northern hemisphere. This could be because habitable land extends more to the north; therefore there is a wider range of data in the north to create a trend. To explain, the latitude axis in the north hemisphere figures have a range of about 80 while the latitude in the southern hemisphere figures has a range of about 55.

3. There are very weak correlations (|r| < 0.3) between cloudiness, humidity, and latitude in each hemisphere. However, unlike temperature, these correlations are in the same direction in both hemispheres (positive).

    Cold northern air can hold more moisture so relative humidity will generally be less.
